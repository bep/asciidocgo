    "Build status", link=https://travis-ci.org/bjornerik/asciidocgo]

Goals
-----
- Asciidoctor compatability

- Blackfriday-like API (drop-in replacement ideally)

- 100% test coverage

Contributing
------------
- We mostly need documentation right now

- Let's move everything to the root level

- A CLI tool is almost literally the last thing we need to work on right now

Code style
----------
- Don't break the tests

- Format with gofmt

- Use Ginkgo for tests

- Comment every new function or struct you add

- Never use `panic` in reachable code

- Use `snake_case` for filenames, camel case for symbols

- Run the tests before (and after) you commit
